# UFOs

The purpose of this assignment is to modify an existing webpage and dynamic table that displays UFO sightings by adding filters for multiple criteria such as city, state, country, and shape. The goal is to allow users to filter the data by multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results:
In order to process results simply enter criteria into the filter section of the webpage and hit enter. 

A drawback of the website is that the data is limited to such a small section of 2010. To make a more robust page we would want to be able to query all data from the UFO data source. For the purposes of this assignment the webpage that was listed in the assignment was not available so I used the data.js file provided in the starter code of the assignemnt. 

For further development I would increade the data set in order to let you filter and retrieve more data, and potentially using machine learning you could pull keywords from the description to get a better understanding of UFO accounts that are similar. In my current coursework that is the last module of our learning.
